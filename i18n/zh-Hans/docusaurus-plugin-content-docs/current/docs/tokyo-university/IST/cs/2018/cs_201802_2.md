# 東京大学 情報理工学系研究科 コンピュータ科学専攻 2018年2月実施 問題2

## **Author**

## **Description**
For each $n \geq 1$, let $\Sigma_n$ be $\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$, where $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are different from each other. For a word $w \in \Sigma_n^*$, we write $|w|_{a_i}$ for the number of occurrences of $a_i$ in $w$. We define the languages $L_{\forall, n}$ and $L_{\exists, n}$ over $\Sigma_n$ by:

$$
L_{\forall, n} = \{w \in \Sigma_n^* \mid |w|_{a_i} \text{ is even for every } i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\},
$$

and

$$
L_{\exists, n} = \{w \in \Sigma_n^* \mid |w|_{a_i} \text{ is even for some } i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\}.
$$

Answer the following questions.

(1) Give a *deterministic* finite state automaton with $4$ states that accepts $L_{\forall, 2}$.

(2) Give a *non-deterministic* finite state automaton with $7$ states (without $\epsilon$-transitions) that accepts $L_{\exists, 3}$.

(3) Prove that, for every $n \geq 1$, every *deterministic* finite state automaton that accepts $L_{\exists, n}$ has at least $2^n$ states.

(4) Prove that, for every $n \geq 1$, every *non-deterministic* finite state automaton (without $\epsilon$-transitions) that accepts $L_{\forall, n}$ has at least $2^n$ states.

Explanation:
- A: "number of $a$'s is **even**, number of $b$'s is **even**"
- B: "number of $a$'s is **odd**, number of $b$'s is **even**"
- C: "number of $a$'s is **even**, number of $b$'s is **odd**"
- D: "number of $a$'s is **odd**, number of $b$'s is **odd**"

Begin with an $\epsilon$-NFA as depiced in Fig. (2-a).
It "guesses" which letter appears even number of times.
To make it $\epsilon$-free, we either follow him: https://youtu.be/sq-dLKAd6bo?t=1714 or consider the followig:
starting from start state, how far, i.e. which states can we reach on letter $a$?
There are $3$ such states.
We simply draw an edge to those states.
Do the same for $b,c$. 
The final answer is on Fig. (2-b)

*Prove that, for every $n\geq 1$, every deterministic finite state automaton that accepts $L_{\exists ,n}$ has at least $2^n$ states.*

*First, I'll show that there is a DFA with $2^n$ states.*
We can encode states of DFA $L_{\exists ,n}$ as a binary string $B = (b_n, b_{n-1}, \cdots, b_2, b_1)$ of length $n$, where $b_i = 1$ iff numbers of $a_i$'s is odd in so-far read sequence, else $0$.
A state is accepting if its binary representation has at least one zero.
There are $2^n$ such strings.

*Now, I'll show that there is no DFA with less than $2^n$ states.*
If the DFA had fewer than $2^n$ states, then there would be some state $q$ such that the DFA can be in state $q$ after reading two different sequences of length $n$, say $a = a_1a_2\cdots a_n$ and $b = b_1b_2\cdots b_n$.
If the sequences were of *different parity*, i.e. one of the sequences had a letter which appears even number of times, and the other sequence hadn't, then $q$ would be both accepting and nonaccepting state.
If the sequences were of the same parity, then we could append some sequence $c_1\cdots c_m \in \Sigma^*$ to $a$ and $b$ such that $a_1a_2\cdots a_n c_1\cdots c_m$ and $b_1b_2\cdots b_n c_1\cdots c_m$ have different parity.
Consider state $p$ that the DFA enters after reading $c_1\cdots c_m$. 
Then $p$ must be both accepting and nonaccepting, since either of
$a_1a_2\cdots a_n c_1\cdots c_m$ and $b_1b_2\cdots b_n c_1\cdots c_m$ is accepted and the other isn't.

This problem could be also one-lined using *Myhill-Nerode theorem*.
The only one difficulty here is to define $2^n$ equivalent classes.
Try fiddling with binary strings.

### (4) - send help
*Prove that, for every $n\geq 1$, every non-deterministic finite state automaton (without $\epsilon$-transitions) that accepts $L_{\forall ,n}$ has at least $2^n$ states.*

Begin with constructing DFA $A$ accepting $L_{\forall ,n}$ the same way as in Q3 – except that $A$ has only one accepting state, a string of all $0$'s.
Obviously this DFA is also a~NFA.
The equivalent NFA simply cannot *guess* parity of some letters: it has to remember information of parity of each letter.
As shown in Q3, every letter requires $2$ bits, so minimum of $2^n$ states are required.
