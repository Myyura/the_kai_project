#### Pipeline hazard
Pipeline hazard refers to a situation where dependencies in a program result in incorrect execution in pipeline or out-of-order execution. There are several types of hazards:
1. **Structure hazard** - Occurs when two commands attempt to access the same memory component at the same time.
2. **Data hazard** - Occurs when a command attempts to use data which has not been finalized yet.
3. **Control hazard** - Occurs when executing a command results in an unwanted jump in the flow of commands (harms the natural order of execution).

#### Register renaming
In compilation, the assembly code may have the same register used in disjoint code parts, which causes unneccesary dependency. 

For out-of-order execution (or pipelining), the latter part must wait sequentially the former part, otherwise **write-after-write** (the former part may read the written value from the latter part) or **write-after-read** hazards (the former part writes after the latter part which causes the register keeps an old value) will happen. 

(These are anti-dependency and output-dependency, which are **false dependencies** so they can be eliminated by register renaming.)

Register renaming can resolve these hazards by **renaming** the shared register in one part with another **free register** to enable out-of-order execution or pipelining.

#### Kalman filter
Please refer to [CI 2011-4, (2)](https://runjp.com/docs/tokyo-university/IST/ci/2012/ci_201108_written_exam_4).

#### Regular grammar and regular languages
> Note: Bracketed information is optional. 选写括号内

A regular language is a formal language (set of sequences of symbols, a subset $L$ of the alphabet $\Sigma$'s Kleene star $\Sigma^*$) whose elements are able to be **accepted by a finite automaton** (DFA or NFA). 

A regular grammar is defined by $G=(N,T,S,P)$:
- $N$ are non terminal symbols (variables).
- $T$ are terminal symbols.
- $S$ is a start symbol.
- $P$ is the production rule for all symbols, where the rules only include these kinds:
  - $A\to aB$ where $a$ is a non-empty terminal, and $A,B$ are nonterminals (a nonterminal generates a terminal and a nonterminal); this rule makes the grammar a left-regular grammar while right-regular ones exist too;
  - $A\to a$ (a nonterminal generates a terminal)
  - $A\to\epsilon$.

A regular language can be generated by a regular grammar.

#### Public key cryptography and certification authority
Public key cryptography refers to a type of security mechanism for a secured message exchange over a public channel between two entities. It uses a private key for each side and a shared public key. The method takes advantage of the difficulty to guess the decomposition of a large number which was a composition of two large prime numbers, as well as modulu operation. The certification authority refers to an entity which can authenticate the trust of a web entity. It is used in regards to SSL for example where a web provider issues a certification with the authority for a secured connection between it and the client. The client uses the certification authority to validate the certificate of the service.

#### Traveling salesman problem
The TSP problem is a classic problem in computer science, which describes a traveling salesman who wants to get the shortest path through each city as a node once and finally back to the starting node. 
This is an NP-hard problem having an exponential time complexity. Suppose there are $N$ cities, then a $\Theta(N!)$ brute-force algorithm and a $\Theta(N^22^N)$ state-compression DP algorithm exist.

Some heuristic solutions exist which reduce the runtime but may not find the optimal solution.

#### Divide and conquer method
Please refer to [CI 2008-4, (1)](https://runjp.com/docs/tokyo-university/IST/ci/2008/ci_200708_written_exam_4).

#### Vector quantization
Used in compression algorithms. Vector quantization refers to the process of assigning representatives (codewords) to groups of vectors based on distance. Such that $V_i(x)=\{y_i:||x-y_i||<||x-y_j||\space for\space j\neq i\}$ for $x\in R^k$ vector of dimension $k$. This allows to generate a lossy compression when used. Vector quantixation defines an encoder, decoder and a codebook to generate the codeword domain.
