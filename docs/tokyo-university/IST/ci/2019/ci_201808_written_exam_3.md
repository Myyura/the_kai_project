1. **Inverse kinematics**
2. **Hidden Markov model**
3. **MinMax algorithm**
4. **NP complete problem**
5. **Ray tracing**
6. **SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)**
7. **Call by value and call by reference**
8. **Public-key cryptography**

**Inverse kinematics**
Inverse kinematics is the usage of kinematic equasions to determine the motions of a robot in order to reach a desired position. Kinematics itself is the study of motion regardless of the cause of the motion, such as forces and torques. Use cases can include the motion of picking bins or items from the assembly line. Given a starting joint position and a desired position, inverse kinematics can determine the join movement needed to achieve that.

**Hidden Markov model**
A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobservable (i.e., hidden) states that generate observable outcomes. HMMs are used in speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. The model assumes that the current state depends only on the previous state and that the observation depends only on the current state.
