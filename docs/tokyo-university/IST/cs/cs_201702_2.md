## **Description**
For a non-deterministic finite automaton $M$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, we write $\mathcal{L}(M) \subseteq \Sigma^*$ for the set of words accepted by $M$. We write $|w|$ for the length of the word $w$, and write $\mathbb{N}$ for the set of non-negative integers.

Answer the following questions:

(1) Consider the non-deterministic finite automaton $M_0$ depicted below, where $q_0$ is the start state, and $q_3$ is the only final state. Give $x, y, z \in \{a, b, c\}^*$ that satisfy all of the following conditions:
   
- (i) $xyz = abcc$
- (ii) $|y| > 0$
- (iii) $x y^n z \in \mathcal{L}(M)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

(2) Prove that, for every non-deterministic finite automaton $M$ consisting of $k$ states and for every $w \in \mathcal{L}(M)$ such that $|w| \ge k$, there exist $x, y,$ and $z$ that satisfy all of the following conditions:

- (i) $xyz = w$
- (ii) $|y| > 0$
- (iii) $|xy| \le k$
- (iv) $x y^n z \in \mathcal{L}(M)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

(3) Prove that there exists no non-deterministic finite automaton $M$ such that $\mathcal{L}(M) = \{ a^m b^n \mid m, n \in \mathbb{N}, 0 < m < n \}$. You may use the fact proved in question (2).

### (1)
$x = a$, $y = bc$ and $z = c$

### (2)
Classic proof of Pumping Lemma (PL) for regular languages.
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be an automaton with $k$ states.
Let $w = a_1a_2\cdots a_k \in L(M)$ such that $|w| > k$.
Now let's simulate run of $\mathcal{M}$ of word $w$.
Define states $p_i = \hat\delta(q_0, w_1w_2\cdots w_i)$.
That is, $p_i$ is a state in which $\mathcal{M}$ is after reading first $i$ inputs.
From pigeonhole principle, at lest two of those state must be exactly the same state.
Let $p_i = p_j$ be the state that is visited the second time for the first time (i.e. $i$ is the smallest among all such states).

I claim that: $w = xyz$, where

- $x = a_1a_2\cdots a_{i-1}$
- $y = a_ia_{i+1}\cdots a_{j-1}$
- $z = a_ja_{j+1}\cdots a_k$

Obviously, $|y| > 0$ because $i\neq j$ and $|xy| = j - 1 \leq n$.
States $p_i, \dots, p_j$ create a loop in the automaton - it can be traversed any number of times, thus $xy^nz \in L(\mathcal{M})$.
For $n=0$ we simply "skip" the loop, for $n\geq 1$ we traverse the loop $n$ times.

### (3)
$L(M) = \{ a^m b^n | n,m \in \mathbb{N}, 0<m<n \}$
Assume that $L$ is regular language.
Then pumping lemma must hold.
Consider $w = a^k b^{k+1} \in L$, where $k$ is the pumping lemma constant.
Because $|w| = 2k + 1 > k$, then there must exist a partitioning
$xyz = w$ such that $|xy| < k$, $|y|>0$ and $xy^nz \in L$ \textbf{for all} $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
Notice that $xy$ consists of $a$'s only.
Let's "pump up" $y$.
For example, $xy^{42}z$ contains of significantly more $a$'s than $b$'s.
This word does not belong to the language.
Contradiction with statement that $x y^n z \in L$ for all $n\in N$.
$L(M)$ is not regular, thus there exist no automaton recognizing it.
