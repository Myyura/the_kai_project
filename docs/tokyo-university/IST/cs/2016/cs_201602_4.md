# 東京大学 情報理工学系研究科 コンピュータ科学専攻 2016年2月実施 問題4

## **Description**
The *majority gate* $\text{M}_3$ is a binary logic gate defined as follows: $\text{M}_3$ has $3$ inputs and $1$ output. The output is $1$ if two or three of the inputs are 1; and 0 otherwise.

When you answer circuit designs in the questions below, you can use NOT gates and constants $0$ and $1$ in addition to $\text{M}_3$ gates, but other gates such as AND or OR cannot be used. You should draw an $\text{M}_3$ gate as a rectangle labeled with $\text{M}_3$, and a NOT gate as a circle, as shown in the following example:

Answer the following questions. Try to make $\text{M}_3$-levels (i.e. the maximum number of serially connected $\text{M}_3$ gates) as small as possible in your answers.

(1) Design and depict the following logic circuits:

- (a) AND of $2$ inputs,  
- (b) OR of $2$ inputs,  
- ($c$) XOR of $2$ inputs.

(2) A 1-bit full adder $\text{FA}_1$ is defined as follows: $\text{FA}_1$ has $3$ inputs and $2$ outputs called $\text{S}$ (sum) and $\text{C}$ (carry), respectively. $\text{S}$ and $\text{C}$ are defined so that $2\text{C} + \text{S}$ is equal to the sum of the $3$ input bits.  
Design and depict a $1$-bit full adder $\text{FA}_1$. Answer its $\text{M}_3$-level, too. You can use the circuits you have designed in Question (1).

(3) Design and depict a $4$-bit full adder $\text{FA}_4$. Answer its $\text{M}_3$-level, too.  

Here $\text{FA}_4$ takes, as inputs: (i) two unsigned $4$-bit integers, and (ii) a carry bit.  
It outputs the $5$-bit sum. You can use the circuits you have designed in Questions (1) and (2).

(4) Design and depict a $4$-bit multiplier $\text{MUL}_4$. Answer its $\text{M}_3$-level, too.  

Here $\text{MUL}_4$ takes two unsigned $4$-bit integers as inputs. It outputs the $8$-bit product of the inputs. You can use the circuits you have designed in Questions (1), (2), and (3).

### (1)
- OR($x, y$) = $majority(0, x, y)$
- AND($x, y$) = $majority(1, x, y)$
- XOR($x, y$) = AND( OR($x,y$), NOT( AND($x, y$) ) = $majority[1, majority(0,x,y) , not\:majority(1, x, y)]$

XOR is "$2$-$\text{M}_3$-level".

### (2)
Classic $1$-bit full adder. 
Just draw a table and then depict the circuit.
Let $a,b,c_{in}$ be inputs.

$$
\begin{aligned}
S = a\veebar b \veebar c_{in}    &&
C = (a\land b) \lor (c_{in} \land (a \lor b))
\end{aligned}
$$

$S$ yields $4$~-~$\text{M}_3$ level (2x XOR).
$C$ yields $3$~-~$\text{M}_3$ level (OR with 2-level AND).
Thus, $\text{FA}_1$ has $4$~-~$\text{M}_3$ level.

Bonus: $C = majority(c_{in}, a,b)$.
Thanks Igor!

### (3)
Connect $4$ $\text{FA}_1$ in series.
It's $\text{M}_3$ level is $4\cdot4 = 16$. 

### (4)
Classic $4$-bit multiplier (google for images).
Connect three $4$-bit adders in series and try not to get messed with connections.
$\text{M}_3$ level is: $3\cdot 16 + 8\cdot 1$: each of three $\text{FA}_4$ has level $16$ and there's one level of $8$ AND gates preceding $\text{FA}_4$'s.
