## **Description**
Answer the following questions regarding undirected graphs. A simple graph is a graph that does not contain any multi-edges or self-loops. A walk is defined as a connected sequence of edges.

(1) Prove that, for any graph $\mathbf{G}$, the number of nodes whose degree is odd is always even.

(2) Write the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ of the following graph, and show that the number of walks of length 2 between nodes 1 and 4 is equal to the $(1,4)$-element of $\mathbf{A}^2$.

```
  1 -- 2
  | \  |
  |  \ |
  3 -- 4
```

(3) Prove that, for any simple graph $\mathbf{G}$ with some adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the number of walks of length $k$ between nodes $i, j$ is equal to the $(i,j)$ element of $\mathbf{A}^k$.

(4) Assume that a simple connected graph $\mathbf{G}$ has two or more nodes. Prove that $\mathbf{G}$ has at least two nodes with identical degree.

(4) 假设一个简单连通图 $\mathbf{G}$ 有两个或更多节点。证明 $\mathbf{G}$ 至少有两个度数相同的节点。

### (1)

To prove this statement, we will use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Mathematically, for a graph $\mathbf{G}$ with vertices $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ and edges $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m\}$, we have:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \deg(v_i) = 2m
$$

where $\deg(v_i)$ is the degree of vertex $v_i$.

Now, consider the sum of the degrees of all vertices. Each degree is either even or odd. Let's denote the number of vertices with odd degree as $n_{odd}$ and the number of vertices with even degree as $n_{even}$. Therefore, we have:

$$
n_{odd} + n_{even} = n
$$

Since the sum of the degrees is even (because it equals $2m$), and the sum of an even number of even numbers is even, the sum of an even number of odd numbers is also even. Therefore, the number of odd-degree vertices, $n_{odd}$, must be even.

Thus, the number of nodes whose degree is odd is always even.

### (2)

The given graph is:

```
  1 -- 2
  | \  |
  |  \ |
  3 -- 4
```

The adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ of this graph is:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

To find the number of walks of length 2 between nodes 1 and 4, we need to compute the matrix $\mathbf{A}^2$:

$$
\mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
3 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The $(1,4)$-element of $\mathbf{A}^2$ is 3, which means there are 3 walks of length 2 between nodes 1 and 4. The walks are:

1. $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4$
2. $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4$

### (3)

We use induction on $k$ to prove this statement.

**Base case**: For $k=1$, the number of walks of length 1 between nodes $i$ and $j$ is given by the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$. If there is an edge between $i$ and $j$, then $\mathbf{A}_{ij}=1$, otherwise $\mathbf{A}_{ij}=0$. Hence, the number of walks of length 1 between nodes $i$ and $j$ is $\mathbf{A}_{ij}$, which is the $(i,j)$ element of $\mathbf{A}$.

**Inductive step**: Assume the statement is true for $k = m$, i.e., the number of walks of length $m$ between nodes $i$ and $j$ is the $(i,j)$ element of $\mathbf{A}^m$. We need to show it is true for $k = m+1$.

The number of walks of length $m+1$ from node $i$ to node $j$ is the sum of the walks of length $m$ from $i$ to all intermediate nodes $k$ and then taking one step from $k$ to $j$. Mathematically, this is:

$$
(\mathbf{A}^{m+1})_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n (\mathbf{A}^m)_{ik} \cdot \mathbf{A}_{kj}
$$

This is precisely the matrix multiplication of $\mathbf{A}^m$ and $\mathbf{A}$, and the result is the $(i,j)$ element of $\mathbf{A}^{m+1}$.

By induction, the number of walks of length $k$ between nodes $i$ and $j$ is equal to the $(i,j)$ element of $\mathbf{A}^k$ for all $k \geq 1$.

### (4)

This proof uses the Pigeonhole Principle.

Let $\mathbf{G}$ be a simple connected graph with $n$ nodes where $n \geq 2$. The degree of a node (vertex) in a simple graph can range from $0$ to $n-1$. In a connected graph with $n \geq 2$, no node can have degree 0, so the possible degrees range from $1$ to $n-1$.

 However, we now have $n$ vertices but only $n-1$ different possible degrees. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we assign $n$ different items (in this case, vertices) into $n-1$ different categories (possible degrees), at least one category must contain more than one item.

Therefore, there must be at least two vertices in the graph that share the same degree.
