### Q.1
We have the following weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G_1$ that has seven nodes named $v_1, v_2, ..., v_7$. The weight of all edges is equal to 1.

(1) List all of the shortest paths from $v_1$ to $v_7$.

(2) Answer the number of directed paths from $v_1$ to $v_7$.

Suppose we have a simple connected weighted DAG $G = (V, E)$ with a set of nodes $V$ and a set of edges $E$. The weight of all edges is equal to 1. For any node $v \in V$, let $N(v) = \{ v' \mid (v', v) \in E \}$. Note that $(v', v)$ indicates an edge from $v'$ to $v$. We suppose $v_s \in V$ is the only node whose $N(v_s)$ is an empty set.

(3) For any node $v \in V - \{v_s\}$, let $s(v)$ denote the number of paths from $v_s$ to $v$, and let $s(v_s) = 1$. Express $s(v)$ using elements of $\{s(v')\}_{v' \in V - \{v\}}$.

(4) For any node $v \in V - \{v_s\}$, let $d(v)$ denote the length of the shortest path from $v_s$ to $v$, and let $d(v_s) = 0$. Express $d(v)$ using elements of $\{d(v')\}_{v' \in V - \{v\}}$.

### Q.2
Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of all non-negative integers and $\mathbb{N}^3 = \{(i, j, k) \mid i, j, k \in \mathbb{N}\}$. We define a total order $\preccurlyeq$ of two elements in $\mathbb{N}^3$ as $(i, j, k) \preccurlyeq (s, t, u)$ if and only if $(i - s, j - t, k - u) = (0, 0, 0)$ or the rightmost non-zero component of $(i - s, j - t, k - u)$ is negative. For example, $(4, 2, 3) \preccurlyeq (5, 2, 3)$, $(4, 2, 3) \preccurlyeq (5, 4, 3)$, and $(4, 2, 3) \preccurlyeq (2, 3, 3)$.

For a given $N \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the task of listing all elements in $S_N = \{(i, j, i^2 + j^2) \in \mathbb{N}^3 \mid 0 \le i \le N, 0 \le j \le N\}$ following the order $\preccurlyeq$, that is, listing all elements in $S_N$ as
$$ (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), ..., (i_n, j_n, {i_n}^2 + {j_n}^2), (i_{n+1}, j_{n+1}, {i_{n+1}}^2 + {j_{n+1}}^2), ..., (N, N, 2N^2) $$
so that $(i_n, j_n, {i_n}^2 + {j_n}^2) \preccurlyeq (i_{n+1}, j_{n+1}, {i_{n+1}}^2 + {j_{n+1}}^2)$ holds for all $n = 1, 2, ..., (N + 1)^2$.

Both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 on the next page are for accomplishing the task with a min-heap $H$ for keeping elements in $S_N$, where "min" means minimum in the order $\preccurlyeq$. Note that "Insert $A$ into $H$" means to insert $A$ into $H$ as its root and to maintain $H$ so that it keeps the heap property. Also, "Extract $A$ from $H$" means to remove $A$ from $H$ and to maintain $H$ so that it keeps the heap property.

**(1)** Draw the heap $H$ of Algorithm 1 as a *tree*, not an array, obtained after executing the part ① for the case $N=2$. Also illustrate step by step how $H$ is maintained in the first repetition of the while loop.

**(2)** Fill $\fbox{\phantom{space}}$ in Algorithm 2 so that the size of $H$ is no more than $N+1$ in the while loop.

**(3)** For the case $N=2$, illustrate step by step how $H$ is maintained in the first and second repetitions of the while loop in Algorithm 2.

**(4)** Let $N \ge 2$. Explain the reason why Algorithm 2 with your answer for (2) works as requested.
